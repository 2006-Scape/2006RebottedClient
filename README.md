## How to Write Scripts for the 2006Rebotted 2.0 Client

The API for the client is available at [Github.com/dginovker/RebottedAPI](https://github.com/dginovker/RebottedAPI)

To write scripts, download the latest API and compile both it and this client into a .jar. Import them as libraries to your Java project, and write it like you would write a [Parabot script](https://www.parabot.org/community/topic/4567-parabot-script-writing-for-dummies-part-1/)
